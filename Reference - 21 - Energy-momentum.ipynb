    "We discussed earlier the *four-velocity*. This is the four-vector tangent to the worldline of an object, describing how the particle is moving along its worldline per unit proper time (the time measured by a clock traveling with the object). This is a proper four-vector obeying Lorentz transformation rules: all observers agree it's the same physical vector, even if they disagree on the components.\n",
    "\n",
    "We saw that the space component of the four-velocity is not the regular 3D velocity, because it picks up an extra $\\gamma$ factor. This is because we take the derivatives with respect to the proper time of an object (experiencing time dilation in any other frame). We have\n",

    "The only relativistically-invariant way to characterize the trajectory of an object is through the four-velocity. It would make sense, then, to try to describe kinematic variables - momentum and energy - in terms of the four-velocity.  Let's look at the low velocity limiting behavior of the four-vector $u$:\n",

Given that at low velocity the space-part of the four-velocity $u$ is just the usual velocity $\\mathbf{v}$, we are tempted to just multiply $u$ by the mass $m$:\n",

There is a $\\frac{1}{2}mv^2$ component which is exactly what we would expect for kinetic energy at speed $v$, but there is a component $m$ which is there even if $v=0$.  If we want to associate the time component with an energy (certainly the $\\frac{1}{2}mv^2$ is very suggestive) then we need to associate an energy $E_0 = m$ that is present for objects regardless of whether they are moving or not (a *rest energy*). We can't redefine the four-vector to get rid of it (otherwise it won't transform properly under Lorentz transformations). The vector $p$ is generally referred to as the *four-momentum*:\n",

    "### A note on units\n",
    "We have been operating with our units in which velocities are unitless and time and space are measured in the same units. This means that the four-velocity is unitless (which makes sense for what is essentially a slope of a line in space-time). If we would like to translate $p = mu$ into normal SI units, we have to \"undo\" setting $c=1$ - equivalently, where we carefully reintroduce factors of $3 \\times 10^8$ m/s. So in SI units we would want the time component (energy) to have units \\[kg\\]\\[m/s\\]<sup>2</sup> - i.e. multiply the mass by $c^2$ - while the space component (momentum) would have units \\[kg\\]\\[m/s\\], so we multiply the mass by $c$. When doing this we also need to replace $v$ (unitless) by $v/c$.\n",

    "### The Case of Light\n",
    "An object moving at the speed of light has zero space-time invariant along its path, so the derivatives with respect to proper time can't be done to define the four-velocity. However we can still define the four-momentum consistent with the particle of light, the photon being massless: $m=0$ implies that $E^2 - \\mathbf{p}^2 = 0$, or $E = |\\mathbf{p}|$.\n",

    "## Why you can't get to the speed of light\n",
    "We've written out the *kinematics* in relativistic language - we have a four-momentum that depends on the velocity. However so far we have not described the *dynamics* - how those kinematics are affected by interactions (forces). In fact it's somewhat rare to do this in practice (outside of electromagnetism).  However we can do this; in a specific frame we can use Newton's second law in the form $\\mathbf{F} = d\\mathbf{p}/dt$ (which is *not* $m\\mathbf{a}$, since $\\gamma$ is a variable now). By applying a constant force in the direction of motion, we can make the momentum magnitude as large as we like. However, this does not mean that the *velocity* will increase towards infinity.\n",
