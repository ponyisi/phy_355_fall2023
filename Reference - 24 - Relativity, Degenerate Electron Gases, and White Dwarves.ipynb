    "## White Dwarf Stars\n",
    "A star like the Sun is actively fusing nuclei together and releasing kinetic energy from these reactions. That makes for a high temperature (and pressure) in the middle of the star, which counteracts gravity trying to pull the mass of the star towards the center.  The heat is eventually lost as thermal radiation from the surface of the star, which needs to match the rate of energy generation in the interior.  This delicate balancing act determines the size and structure of the star.\n",
    "\n",
    "The core of a star like the Sun does not get hot enough during the star's life cycle to fuse nuclei to anything heavier than carbon and oxygen. When these elements build up, the heat-producing mechanism of the star slows and stops, and (eventually) the core is no longer able to support itself by generating new kinetic energy.  It contracts until electron degeneracy pressure is able to balance the force of gravity, at which point it is called a *white dwarf* star.  We can qualitatively understand the situation by looking for the radius that gives the minimum sum of the gravitational potential energy of the matter and the kinetic energy of the electrons.  If we make the assumption that the star has uniform density in this stage, then the gravitational potential energy is\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ U = -\\frac{3}{5}\\frac{GM^2}{R} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $R$ is the radius of the star and $M$ is the total mass of the star. Because the star's mass is mostly protons and neutrons, and for carbon-12 or oxygen-16 the number of protons and neutrons are equal, we have $M \\approx N (2 m_p)$, where $N$ is the total number of electrons in the star from above.\n",
    "\n",

Many stellar remnants of this kind are known; Sirius B, the companion star of Sirius A, was first directly observed in 1862, after being predicted twenty years earlier from its gravitational effect on Sirius A.  (Sirius B is almost exactly the mass of the sun, and is a little smaller than our prediction - $5.9 \\times 10^{6}$ m - because we have neglected relativity and the actual pressure/density profile of the star.)

This is the *same* dependence as the gravitational potential energy. In the non-relativistic case, for small $R$, the $1/R^2$ kinetic energy term will always eventually win over the $1/R$ potential energy, so there will always be a minimum. But for relativistic electrons, unless the kinetic energy and potential energy terms exactly cancel, the minimum will either be at $R=0$ (the star collapses to nothing) or at $R=\\infty$ (the star explodes).

    "If we keep adding mass to a white dwarf with non-relativistic electrons, we will keep raising the energy of the highest energy electrons, and we will approach the ultrarelativistic limit. A more careful calculation, taking into account a realistic star density profile ([Chandrasekhar 1931](https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/91/5/456/985147)), gives a limit mass (the *Chandrasekhar limit*) closer to $1.4 M_\\odot$. Above this mass, electron degeneracy pressure is no longer able to support the star, and it will collapse.  If it's not too heavy, it will turn into what is basically a gigantic nucleus composed of neutrons (a *neutron star*), prevented from further collapse by *neutron* degeneracy pressure and neutron-neutron repulsion; if it's heavier than $\\sim 2-3 M_\\odot$ nothing can stop it and it will collapse into a black hole."
