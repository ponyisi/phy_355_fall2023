    "## Reproducing Time Dilation and Length Contraction\n",
    "\n",
    "We have earlier said that time dilation and length contraction were specific cases of the result of Lorentz transformations. Let's look into this.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Time Dilation\n",
    "Let's assume that a clock is at rest at the origin in the unprimed frame, i.e. $x=0$ for all $t$.  Consider two events, the first at $t=0$ and the second at $t=T$. By our definition, the *proper time* between the events is $T$. In another (primed) frame moving at velocity $v$ along the $x$ axis, where $t'=0$ and $x'=0$ are the same event as $t=0$, $x=0$, then the Lorentz transformation tells us that the coordinates of the second event are\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{align*}\n",
    "T' &= \\gamma(T - vx)\\\\\n",
    "   &= \\gamma(T - 0) = \\gamma T > T\\\\\n",
    "x' &= \\gamma(x - vT)\\\\\n",
    "   &= \\gamma(0 - vT) = -\\gamma v T\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "So any other frame will measure a longer time $T' = \\gamma T$ than the time $T$ measured in the frame where the events occur in the same place.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Length Contraction\n",
    "This one is a little harder.  Let's consider an object with edges at $x_1=0$ and $x_2=L$. When we put the coordinates in to the Lorentz transformation, we need to put in a time as well, because the Lorentz transformation is transforming the coordinates of *events*. We cannot just Lorentz transform the space coordinates; we need to put in time coordinates as well. Let's first choose the time $t_1=t_2=0$. What do we get?\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{align*}\n",
    "x_1' &= \\gamma(x_1 - vt_1) = 0\\\\\n",

    "&= \\gamma L\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "That seems strange; $x_2'-x_1' = \\gamma L$, which is longer than $L$, but we were promised a length *contraction*, while this would appear to be an expansion. What is going on?\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see what happens to the *times* of the events. Remember events are four-dimensional locations, so it's not really meaningful to just talk about the space part of an event.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{align*}\n",
    "t_1' &= \\gamma(t_1 - vx_1) = 0\\\\\n",

    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The *times* of the two observations are no longer the same. This is just a consequence of the fact that simultaneity is lost when changing to a new reference frame that is moving relative to the first one.  From the point of view of the primed frame, the object is moving towards $-x$ at speed $v$, and what we find is a space separation $\\gamma L$ between the left side of the object, *measured at $t=0$*, and the right side of the object, *measured at $t=-\\gamma v L$*, i.e. *before* the position of the left side of the object is measured! There is no more paradox, because the measurements of the position of the edges of the object are no longer simultaneous in the primed frame.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can solve this by determining the equation of the *world-lines* of the left and right sides of the object. In the unprimed frame, $x_1(t) = 0$ and $x_2(t) = L$.  In the primed frame,\n",
    "\n",

    "t_2' &= \\gamma(t_2 - v L)\\\\\n",
    "t_2 &= \\frac{1}{\\gamma}t_2' + vL\\\\\n",
    "\\Rightarrow x_2'(t_2') &= \\gamma\\left(L - \\frac{v}{\\gamma}t_2' - v^2 L\\right)\\\\\n",
    "&= -v t_2' + \\gamma(1-v^2)L = -v t_2' + \\frac{1-v^2}{\\sqrt{1-v^2}} L\\\\\n",

    "These are the equations for points moving with speed $v$ towards $-x$, as we expect. If we compare $x_1'$ and $x_2'$ at the same time in the *primed* frame ($t_1'=t_2'$) then indeed the difference $x_2'-x_1' = L/\\gamma$ and we have a length contraction."

    "## The Twin Paradox\n",
    "\n",
    "Astronaut Alice sets out to follow Spaceman Spiff to Barnard's Star at a large fraction of the speed of light. On arriving she turns around and heads back to Earth at the same speed. Bob, her twin, has stayed on Earth the whole time. When they meet again, Bob says that Alice has been experiencing time dilation all the while because she has been moving at high speed relative to him, so she is now younger than he is. Alice retorts that Bob has been moving at the equivalently high speed relative to her, and so _he_ has experienced time dilation and is now the younger sibling. Which is correct?\n",
    "\n",
    "We might be tempted to say that the departure and arrival both happen at the same place ($x=0$) in both twins' reference frames, so they can both claim to have measured the proper time.  However this is not the case; one, and only one, twin has experienced significant acceleration to get between the departure and arrival events.  Alice has felt fictitous forces while turning around at Barnard's Star, so during that period her reference frame is no longer inertial.  So, even though she was in an intertial frame during her journey to and from the star, they are critically not the *same* reference frame, and to go from one to the other required a change of frame.  During the acceleration, if Alice had been observing carefully, she would have observed Bob age rapidly.  Bob, on the other hand, was always in an inertial frame (or close enough).\n",
    "\n",
    "To reconcile the fact that both Alice and Bob think the other's clock is slowed down during Alice's outbound journey: the core issue is, again, simultaneity. If Alice is traveling at speed $v$, Bob measures Alice to arrive at Barnard's Star at $t = D/v$ ($D$ being the distance to the star).  Alice measures the time to be $t' = (D/\\gamma)/v$ (due to length contraction of the Earth-star distance), so Bob thinks Alice's clock is slower.  On the other hand, from Alice's point of view, when she arrives at the star, Earth is at position $x'=-D/\\gamma$, and Bob's clock reads (using the inverse Lorentz transformation)\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ t = \\gamma(t' + vx') = D/v - D < D/v $$\n",
    "\n",
    "i.e. \"Bob's time when Alice arrives at the star\" is not a frame invariant statement, as it relates events in two different locations.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Space-time coordinates with Lorentz transformed axes](images/space_time_diagram_lorentz.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary:\n",
    "* While Alice is not accelerating (outbound or inbound) she is correct in her claim that she observes Bob to be experiencing time dilation.\n",
    "* When Alice stops and reverses direction at the star, she is no longer in an inertial reference frame, and our normal Lorentz transformation statements don't apply. Bob appears to age rapidly from her point of view.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we recall the apparent paradox of the stars appearing to move far faster than light when observed in a rotating reference frame, this is just the time version. When an object's velocity changes it can \"mess up\" the time coordinate at a large distance from the origin of the reference frame and cause objects to appear to change coordinate in an unphysical manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "The twin paradox is a special case of a general rule, which is that if we consider all possible trajectories for clocks to travel been two (timelike separated) space-time events, the clock that reads the *longest* time is the one that travels between the two at uniform velocity (i.e. in an inertial frame).  All other trajectories will result in clocks that read a shorter time. To avoid confusion, the rules again:\n",
    "* when comparing different _inertial_ reference frames, the frame in which two timelike separated events happen at the same space position records the _shortest_ time (proper time).\n",
    "* when comparing different _trajectories_ between the same two events, which can involve acceleration, a clock that travels in an inertial frame between the two events records the _longest_ time.\n"

    "If we can describe the world-line of an object with a set of position coordinates, its position can be described by a four-vector displacement from the origin. Now, of course, in Newtonian physics we would write the position of an object as a function of the time, $\\mathbf{x}(t)$.  In 4D, the time itself is a coordinate, so this is inappropriate.  It turns out that a good choice of parametric variable is the _proper time_ of the object (generally denoted $\\tau$), i.e. the time that would be read by a clock attached to the object.  All reference frames agree on the proper time of the object at any event, even though they will disagree on their own time coordinate $t$.  The proper time is defined even if the object is accelerating (like Astronaut Alice reversing at Barnard's Star).  So one normally writes the position four-vector\n",
