    "### Units\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we would like time and space to be measured in the same units. \n",
    "* the ratio of the units is a velocity, and since the one universal velocity seems to be the speed of light, we'll measure $t$ in terms of the distance that light goes in the corresponding number of seconds. \n",

    "   * alternatively we can measure space in seconds: a light-second, $3 \\times 10^8$ m, is a second of space  \n",

    "* the speed $c$ is one meter per meter, and hence 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Coordinates\n",
    "\n",
    "Two frames that are in motion relative to each other can share a 4D origin (i.e., the points $(t, x, y, z) = (0,0,0,0)$ and $(t', x', y', z') = (0,0,0,0)$ correspond to the same event). The idea of \"rotations\" in space-time runs into a few issues that show that there are differences from the \"usual\" idea of space rotations:\n",
    "* With regular rotations, if I rotate by 180 degrees I reverse the sign of both coordinates. However there is no evidence that you can reverse the sign of time by just going fast enough.  \n",
    "   * It's important that we cannot do this because then we could disrupt causality: we think that the order of events that cause each other is important.\n",
    "* If we plot $t$ versus $x$, the position of a flash of light describes a line $t = x$.  The condition that the speed of light is the same for all reference frames means that the slope of this line must remain constant in all reference frames. But ordinary rotations change the slopes of lines.\n",
    "\n",
    "The latter point means that the thing that is preserved cannot be, say. $\\Delta t^2 + \\Delta x^2$; applied to the propagation of a flash of light, this would imply that in some frame we could stop the light (the separation would be all $\\Delta t$) or to have it move infinitely fast (the separation would be all $\\Delta x$).  \n",
    "* we can see the outlines of the solution: we can instead demand that $\\Delta t^2 - \\Delta x^2$ remain constant. \n",
    "* that would at least preserve the speed of light in all frames, as the trajectory of a flash of light will always satisfy $\\Delta t = \\Delta x$.\n",

    "### Space-Time Invariant\n",
    "\n",
    "In the full four dimensions, we therefore require that all coordinates (in inertial reference frames) keep the following unchanged:\n",

    "\n",
    "This is called the _space-time invariant_ and, unlike a usual distance, can be positive or negative. \n",
    "* normal 3D rotations are a subset of acceptable coordinate transformations since they leave the time part untouched and only touch the space coordinates, and by definition preserve $\\Delta x^2 + \\Delta y^2 + \\Delta z^2$.  \n",
    "* we are permitted a new freedom, to mix $t$ and the space coordinates.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The invariant can be positive or negative, and this has implications. \n",
    "\n",
    "If the invariant between two events is *positive*, this implies that the *time* separation $\\Delta t$ between the two is greater than the *space* separation $\\Delta r = \\sqrt{\\Delta x^2 + \\Delta y^2 + \\Delta z^2}$.  \n",
    "* This means that an object traveling with uniform velocity between the two events would have speed $\\Delta r/\\Delta t < 1$, i.e. it would be moving slower than the speed of light.  \n",
    "* From the reference frame of the object, a time $\\Delta t'$ elapses between the two events, and the two events happen in the same place ($\\Delta r' = 0$). \n",
    "   * Since this is the smallest $\\Delta r'$ possible, it must be the smallest $\\Delta t'$ possible - this is the *proper time* between the two events. \n",
    "   * This confirms our idea that the proper time between events is the time measured in an inertial reference frame in which the events happen in the same location. \n",
    "* Events with positive space-time invariant between them are called *timelike separated*.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the invariant is *negative*, things are different. \n",
    "* If it is possible to send an object between the two events, then in the object's reference frame $\\Delta t' > 0$ and $\\Delta r' = 0$, which would give a *positive* invariant and contradict the universality of the invariant. \n",
    "* So we conclude *it is not possible for an object to travel between two events separated by a negative space-time invariant*. \n",
    "   * Such an object would need to be moving with speed $\\Delta r/\\Delta t > 1$, which would be faster than light. \n",
    "   * Therefore *it is not possible for objects to travel faster than the speed of light.*  \n",
    "* Events with negative space-time invariant between them are called *spacelike separated*.  \n",
    "* For such events, it is possible to find a reference frame in which the events occur at the same time ($\\Delta t' = 0$).  \n",
    "* The $\\Delta r'$ in this frame is _not_ the proper length that gets considered for length contraction!\n",
    "\n",
    "Events that are separated by an invariant of zero are called *lightlike separated*, which means that something moving at the speed of light could connect them.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For a given event, the set of all other events that are lightlike separated from it is called the _light cone_ of that event. The timelike-separated events are _inside_ the light cone and the spacelike-separated ones are _outside_ it.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Light cones](images/lightcones.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Because nothing can move faster than light, if an event is going to send a signal to another event, they need to be timelike or lightlike separated. \n",
    "* Therefore causal relationships can only exist between events that lie within (or on) each other's light cones. \n",
