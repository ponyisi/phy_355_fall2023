    "* For gravity and electromagnetism this effect is generally small enough to be ignored, but for nuclear forces it is noticeable. \n",
    "* For example, let's consider the helium-4 nucleus, which has two protons and two neutrons:\n",
    "    * the proton mass is 1.007276 amu, the neutron mass is 1.008664 amu; so the total mass of two free protons and two free neutrons is 4.03188 amu;\n",

When a star generates an iron core, this is no longer able to generate thermal energy to support itself (and starts to be dominated by electron degeneracy pressure instead, like a metal). If the core gets too heavy, it will no longer be able to keep itself stable against gravity pulling it in, and will collapse to form a neutron star or a black hole, in the process creating a Type II supernova.\n",
